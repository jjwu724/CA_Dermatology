      <h2 id="blr">Benign Lesion Removal</h2><hr>
      <p>A procedure to remove non-cancerous skin growths, such as skin tags or seborrheic keratoses, often through cutting, scraping, or freezing. It's used for cosmetic reasons or to relieve discomfort. The method depends on the lesion's size and location.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="cae">Cherry Angioma Electrocautery</h2><hr>
      <p>A technique that uses a small electric current to burn off cherry angiomas—bright red, benign spots caused by tiny blood vessels. It seals the area as it works, minimizing bleeding. The process is quick and targets only the growth.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="cry">Cryotherapy</h2><hr>
      <p>A treatment that applies extreme cold, usually liquid nitrogen, to freeze and destroy abnormal skin cells, like warts or precancerous spots. The frozen area eventually peels off. It's simple and commonly done in a single session.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="cyr">Cyst Removal</h2><hr>
      <p>A surgical process to extract cysts—fluid-filled or solid sacs under the skin—often through a small incision and drainage or complete removal. It addresses lumps that may cause pain or cosmetic concerns. Stitches may be needed afterward.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="der">Dermatofibroma Removal</h2><hr>
      <p>A procedure to cut out dermatofibromas—firm, benign bumps often on the legs, caused by minor injury or unknown factors. It's typically done for appearance or if irritation occurs. The removal leaves a small scar that fades over time.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="mol">Mole Removal</h2><hr>
      <p>A procedure to remove benign or suspicious moles for cosmetic reasons or cancer concerns, typically on the face or body. Techniques vary based on the mole's nature. Treatments include shave excision, surgical excision, or laser removal for select cases.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="shr">Sebaceous Hyperplasia Removal</h2><hr>
      <p>A procedure to remove sebaceous hyperplasia—small, yellowish bumps from enlarged oil glands, often on the face. It uses techniques like electrocautery, cryotherapy, or laser to smooth the skin. The process targets these benign growths for cosmetic improvement.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="skb">Skin Biopsy</h2><hr>
      <p>A technique that takes a small sample of skin for testing, usually with a blade, punch tool, or shave method, to diagnose conditions like cancer. The site is numbed, and a few stitches may close it. It's a quick way to check suspicious spots.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="str">Skin Tag Removal</h2><hr>
      <p>A process to cut, freeze, or burn off skin tags—soft, harmless flaps of skin often found on the neck, armpits, or groin. It's simple and fast, addressing cosmetic or comfort issues. The area heals with minimal scarring.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="tee">Telangiectasia Electrocautery</h2><hr>
      <p>A treatment that uses an electric current to seal telangiectasia—tiny, visible blood vessels (spider veins) on the skin, often red or blue. It collapses the vessels, fading their appearance. It's a precise option for cosmetic enhancement.</p>
