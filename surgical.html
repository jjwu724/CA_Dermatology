      <p>Fluid-filled or semi-solid sacs beneath the skin, often painless but sometimes tender or inflamed, commonly on the face, neck, or trunk. Treatments involve surgical excision, drainage, or corticosteroid injections to reduce inflammation.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="mel">Melanoma</h2><hr>
      <p>A dangerous skin cancer arising from pigment-producing cells, often presenting as an asymmetrical, irregularly colored mole that changes over time. Early detection is critical. Treatments include wide surgical excision, immunotherapy, or radiation for advanced cases.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="mol">Mole Removal</h2><hr>
      <p>A procedure to remove benign or suspicious moles for cosmetic reasons or cancer concerns, typically on the face or body. Techniques vary based on the mole’s nature. Treatments include shave excision, surgical excision, or laser removal for select cases.</p>

      <h2 id="scc">Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h2><hr>
      <p>A skin cancer forming in the outer layers, often as a scaly, red patch or sore that doesn’t heal, linked to sun exposure. It can spread if untreated. Treatments include Mohs surgery, excision, or radiation therapy for deeper cases.</p>
