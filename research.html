      <h2 id="aa">Alopecia Areata</h2><hr>
      <p>An autoimmune condition causing sudden, patchy hair loss on the scalp or body as the immune system targets hair follicles. It often results in round bald spots that can vary in size. Our research explores new ways to stimulate regrowth and calm the immune response.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="ad">Atopic Dermatitis</h2><hr>
      <p>A chronic, itchy inflammation of the skin, often tied to allergies or genetics, marked by red, scaly patches on the face, arms, or legs. Our studies aim to uncover advanced therapies to soothe irritation and strengthen the skin barrier.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="bp">Bullous Pemphigoid</h2><hr>
      <p>A rare blistering disorder, typically in older adults, where the immune system attacks the skin, forming large, tense blisters. Our trials investigate innovative treatments to reduce blistering and improve skin resilience.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="cl">Cutaneous Lupus</h2><hr>
      <p>A form of lupus affecting the skin, causing red, scaly rashes or sores, often worsened by sun exposure. Our research seeks novel approaches to manage symptoms and protect against flare-ups.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="hs">Hidradenitis Suppurativa</h2><hr>
      <p>A painful, chronic condition featuring inflamed, boil-like lumps in areas like the armpits or groin due to blocked hair follicles. Our studies focus on cutting-edge options to ease discomfort and prevent scarring.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="hi">Hives (Urticaria)</h2><hr>
      <p>Itchy, raised welts triggered by allergies, stress, or infections, appearing suddenly and fading within hours. Our trials explore next-level solutions to control outbreaks and address underlying causes.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="ps">Psoriasis</h2><hr>
      <p>An autoimmune disorder producing red, scaly patches from rapid skin cell buildup, often on the elbows, knees, or scalp. Our research tests groundbreaking methods to slow cell growth and relieve symptoms.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="vi">Vitiligo</h2><hr>
      <p>A condition where skin loses pigment in patches due to melanocyte damage, possibly autoimmune-related, creating stark white areas. Our studies pioneer treatments to restore color and halt progression.</p>
