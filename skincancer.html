      <h2 id="bcc">Basal Cell Carcinoma</h2><hr>
      <p>The most common form of skin cancer, appearing as a pearly or waxy bump, often on sun-exposed areas like the face or neck. It grows slowly but can invade nearby tissues if untreated. Treatments include surgical excision, Mohs surgery, or cryotherapy for smaller lesions.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="mel">Melanoma</h2><hr>
      <p>A dangerous skin cancer arising from pigment-producing cells, often presenting as an asymmetrical, irregularly colored mole that changes over time. Early detection is critical. Treatments include wide surgical excision, immunotherapy, or radiation for advanced cases.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="scc">Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h2><hr>
      <p>A skin cancer forming in the outer layers, often as a scaly, red patch or sore that doesn't heal, linked to sun exposure. It can spread if untreated. Treatments include Mohs surgery, excision, or radiation therapy for deeper cases.</p>

      <h2 id="cad">Curettage and Desiccation</h2><hr>
      <p>A procedure that scrapes away abnormal skin growths with a scoop-like tool, then uses an electric current to dry and destroy remaining cancer cells. It's commonly used for small, shallow skin cancers. The process is straightforward and typically done in a single visit.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="ex">Excision</h2><hr>
      <p>A surgical technique that removes skin cancer by cutting it out along with a small margin of surrounding healthy tissue to ensure it's fully gone. It's often applied to larger or deeper growths. Stitches are used to close the area afterward.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="ms">Mohs Surgery</h2><hr>
      <p>A method that removes skin cancer layer by layer, checking each under a microscope until no cancer remains, sparing as much healthy skin as possible. It's suited for cancers in visible or sensitive areas. The approach aims to balance thoroughness with minimal impact.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="srt">Superficial Radiation Therapy</h2><hr>
      <p>A non-invasive treatment using low-energy X-rays to target and destroy abnormal skin cells, often for early-stage cancers or precancerous spots. It's precise, sparing healthy tissue, and ideal for areas like the face or neck. Sessions are quick, painless, and require no cutting or downtime.</p>
