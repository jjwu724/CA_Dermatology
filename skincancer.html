      <p>The most common form of skin cancer, appearing as a pearly or waxy bump, often on sun-exposed areas like the face or neck. It grows slowly but can invade nearby tissues if untreated. Treatments include surgical excision, Mohs surgery, or cryotherapy for smaller lesions.</p>

      <h2 id="mel">Melanoma</h2><hr>
      <p>A dangerous skin cancer arising from pigment-producing cells, often presenting as an asymmetrical, irregularly colored mole that changes over time. Early detection is critical. Treatments include wide surgical excision, immunotherapy, or radiation for advanced cases.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="scc">Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h2><hr>
      <p>A skin cancer forming in the outer layers, often as a scaly, red patch or sore that doesn't heal, linked to sun exposure. It can spread if untreated. Treatments include Mohs surgery, excision, or radiation therapy for deeper cases.</p>
