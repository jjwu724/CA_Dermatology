    <section>
      <h2 id="as">Age Spots</h2><hr>
      <p>Flat, brown, or grayish patches that appear on sun-exposed areas like the face, hands, or arms, often due to years of UV exposure or aging. These benign spots can dull skin's evenness. Treatments include topical lightening creams, chemical peels, or laser therapy to fade their appearance.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="bi">Birthmarks</h2><hr>
      <p>Colored marks present at birth or soon after, ranging from red or purple (vascular) to brown or black (pigmented), typically on the face or body. While harmless, they may affect confidence. Treatments like laser therapy or pulsed light can soften or remove them for a smoother look.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="ce">Cellulite</h2><hr>
      <p>A condition causing dimpled, uneven skin texture, often on the thighs, hips, or buttocks, due to fat pushing against connective tissue. It's common and cosmetic, not health-related. Treatments such as laser therapy, radiofrequency, or fillers can smooth and tighten the skin's surface.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="sm">Stretch Marks</h2><hr>
      <p>Long, narrow streaks or lines that form when skin stretches rapidly, such as during pregnancy or growth spurts. They often appear red, purple, or white on the belly, thighs, or arms. Treatments include topical retinoids, microneedling, or laser therapy to reduce their visibility and refine their texture.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="ss">Sun Spots</h2><hr>
      <p>Dark, flat spots caused by prolonged sun exposure, typically on the face, hands, or shoulders, varying from light tan to deep brown. They can make skin tone uneven. Treatments like chemical peels, cryotherapy, or intense pulsed light (IPL) help lift and fade these marks.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="wr">Wrinkles</h2><hr>
      <p>Lines or creases that deepen with age, sun exposure, or repetitive facial movements, often around the eyes, forehead, or mouth. They reflect time's natural wear. Treatments range from neuromodulators (like Botox), fillers, or laser resurfacing to smooth and rejuvenate the skin.</p>
      <br>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="cp">Chemical Peels</h2><hr>
      <p>A treatment that applies a specialized solution to exfoliate the skin's surface, peeling away dead cells to reveal a fresher layer beneath. It targets uneven tone, fine lines, or sun damage. Options range from light peels for a quick refresh to deeper peels for more dramatic smoothing.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="fi">Fillers</h2><hr>
      <p>Injectable gels, often hyaluronic acid-based, that add volume and smooth out wrinkles, hollows, or scars, typically in areas like the cheeks, lips, or under eyes. They restore youthful contours instantly. Results are tailored with precise placement by our skilled team.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="la">Lasers</h2><hr>
      <p>Focused light energy treatments that resurface skin, fade spots, or tighten texture by stimulating collagen or targeting pigments. They address wrinkles, sun spots, or birthmarks with precision. Sessions vary from gentle rejuvenation to intensive correction, customized to your needs.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 id="ne">Neuromodulators</h2><hr>
      <p>Injections like Botox that relax facial muscles to soften dynamic wrinkles—such as crow's feet or forehead lines—caused by repeated expressions. Effects are subtle yet striking, lasting months. Our experts ensure a natural look with every dose.</p>
      <br>
      <a class="storeUrl" target="_blank"><h2 id="sc">Skin Care</h2></a><hr>
      <p>A personalized regimen of cleansers, moisturizers, and targeted products to maintain and enhance your skin's health and glow between treatments. It tackles daily wear, dryness, or unevenness. We guide you with expert advice and professional-grade options.
